## About

This game was created as an **experiment in AI-assisted software development**. The entire codebase was generated by a **local LLM running on consumer hardware**, with no external assets — all graphics are procedurally generated in code.

### Features

- 🎮 Classic Flappy Bird gameplay mechanics
- 🌅 Procedurally generated sky gradient background with animated sun
- ☁️ Floating clouds
- 🟢 Randomized pipe obstacles
- ✨ Particle effects trail
- 📊 Score tracking with high score persistence (per session)
- ⏸️ Pause functionality
- 🖱️ Mouse and keyboard controls

## AI Generation Details

### Hardware

- **Mac Mini Pro** with **64GB** of unified memory

### Software

- [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/) v0.3.36
- Model: [Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct-MLX-8bit](https://huggingface.co/lmstudio-community/Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct-MLX-8bit) (MLX optimized for Apple Silicon)

### Performance

The local LLM achieved excellent performance during code generation:

| Metric | Value |
| ------ | ----- |
| Generation Speed | **51.28 tok/sec** |
| Total Tokens | 3,580 |
| Time to First Token | 0.71s |

### Prompt

This was the initial prompt ([source](https://digitalspaceport.com/about/testing-local-llms/)) that I used. The game worked with some issues on the graphics, like leaving trails, but with few additional prompts I was able to get it finished.

> You are an expert Python Developer. Create a highly accurate flappybird game clone called "Rara Avis" in python. Add all additional features that would be expected in a common user interface. Do not use external assets for anything. If you need assets created, generate them in the code only. Only use pygame. Game features: Classic Flappy Bird gameplay mechanics, procedurally generated sky gradient background with animated sun, Floating clouds, Randomized pipe obstacles, Particle effects trail (Make sure the bird doesn't leave any trail while moving), Score tracking with high score persistence (per session), Pause functionality, Mouse and keyboard controls (space to control de bird, to start and restart). Fully review your code and correct any issues after you produce the first version.
