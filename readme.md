## About

This game was created as an experiment in AI-assisted game development. The entire codebase was generated by a local LLM running on consumer hardware, with no external assets — all graphics are procedurally generated in code.

## AI Generation Details

### Hardware

- **Mac Mini Pro** with **64GB** of unified memory

### Software

- [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/) v0.3.36
- Model: [Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct-MLX-8bit](https://huggingface.co/lmstudio-community/Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct-MLX-8bit) (MLX optimized for Apple Silicon)

### Prompt

This was the initial prompt that I used. The game worked with some issues on the graphics, like leaving trails, but with few additional prompts I was able to get it finished.

> You are an expert Python Developer. Create a highly accurate flappybird game clone called flippyblock extreme in python. Add all additional features that would be expected in a common user interface. Do not use external assets for anything. If you need assets created, generate them in the code only. Only use pygame. Fully review your code and correct any issues after you produce the first version.

## Controls

| Action | Input |
